Hi there! I'm Pengyuan Liu, currently serving as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Coordinator for the Sea-City Interface Project at Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) at Singapore-ETH Centre. My expertise lies in the field of quantitative urban geography, where I specialise in GeoAI and urban digital twin research. I hold a PhD in Geography from the University of Leicester, UK. Before joining FCL Global, I contributed as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Human Geography and Urban Planning at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China. My academic journey also includes valuable postdoctoral research experiences at the Urban Analytics Lab, National University of Singapore and the University of Helsinki.

I am deeply passionate about integrating geospatial analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital twins within urban studies. My work focuses on developing theories, algorithms, and models that advance this integration. Additionally, I am an advocate for the open data initiative in academia, demonstrated by my role in organizing international academic conferences for OpenStreetMap, including the 2022 State of the Map (Academic Track) and 2023 OSMScience. My aim is to foster innovation in urban studies through cutting-edge research and collaboration, contributing to the development of smarter, more sustainable urban environments.
