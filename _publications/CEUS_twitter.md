title: "A graph-based semi-supervised approach to classification learning in digital geographies"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a new tool for studies in digital geographies, bridging qualitative and quantitative approaches, able to learn a set of arbitrary labels (qualitative codes) on a small, manually-created sample and apply the same labels on a larger set. We introduce a semi-supervised, deep neural network approach to classify geo-located social media posts based on their textual and image content, as well as geographical and temporal aspects. Our innovative approach is rooted in our understanding of social media posts as augmentations of the time-space configurations that places are, and it comprises a stacked multi-modal autoencoder neural network to create joint representations of text and images, and a spatio-temporal graph convolution neural network for semi-supervised classification. The results presented in this paper show that our approach performs the classification of social media content with higher accuracy than traditional machine learning models as well as two state-of-art deep learning frameworks.'
