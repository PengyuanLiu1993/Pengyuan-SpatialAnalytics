title: "Explainable spatially explicit geospatial artificial intelligence in urban analytics"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) is proliferating in urban analytics, where graph neural networks (GNNs) have become one of the most popular methods in recent years. However, along with the success of GNNs, the black box nature of AI models has led to various concerns (e.g. algorithmic bias and model misuse) regarding their adoption in urban analytics, particularly when studying socio-economics where high transparency is a crucial component of social justice. Therefore, the desire for increased model explainability and interpretability has attracted increasing research interest. This article proposes an explainable spatially explicit GeoAI-based analytical method that combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a graph-based explainable AI (XAI) method, called GNNExplainer.'
