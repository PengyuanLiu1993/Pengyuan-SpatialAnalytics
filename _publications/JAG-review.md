title: "A review of spatially-explicit GeoAI applications in Urban Geography"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'This paper provides an overview of techniques and applications of spatially-explicit GeoAI in Urban Geography based on 581 papers identified using a systematic review approach. We examined and screened papers in three scopes of Urban Geography (Urban Dynamics, Social Differentiation of Urban Areas, and Social Sensing) and found that although GeoAI is a trending topic in geography and the applications of deep neural network-based methods are proliferating, the development of spatially-explicit GeoAI models is still at their early phase. We identified three challenges of existing models and advised future research direction towards developing multi-scale explainable spatially-explicit GeoAI. This review paper acquaints beginners with the basics of GeoAI and state-of-the-art and serves as an inspiration to attract more research in exploring the potential of spatially-explicit GeoAI in studying the socioeconomic dimension of the city and urban life.'
