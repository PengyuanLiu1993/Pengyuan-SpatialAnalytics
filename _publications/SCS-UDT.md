title: "Towards Human-centric Digital Twins: Leveraging Computer Vision and Graph Models to Predict Outdoor Comfort"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'Conventional sidewalk studies focused on quantitative analysis of sidewalk walkability at a large scale which cannot capture the dynamic interactions between the environment and individual factors. Embracing the idea of Tech for Social Good, Urban Digital Twins seek AI-empowered approaches to bridge humans with digitally-mediated technologies to enhance their prediction ability. We employ GraphSAGE-LSTM, a geo-spatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) framework on crowdsourced data and computer vision to predict human comfort on the sidewalks.'
